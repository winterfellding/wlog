##### Storage definition and notation

basic unit of computer storage is 1 bite, which contains value 0 or 1,  1 byte = 8 bit,
on a 64-bit register and 64-bit memory addressing typically has 64-bit (8-byte) words.

##### Storage structure

Most computer run their programs from rewritable memory, which is called main memory,
(also called random-access-memory or RAM), they commonly is implemented in a semiconductor
technology called dynamic random-access memory (DRAM).

Computer also use other forms of memory, which include:
ROM read-only memory, it can not be changed, only static programs.
EEPROM electrically erasable programmable read-only memory, it can be changed, but cannot be changed frequently,
so contains mostly static programs, for example: smart phone have EEPROM to store their factory-installed programs.
