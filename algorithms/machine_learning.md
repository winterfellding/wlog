### Supervised Learning

	Given the "right answer" for each example in the data.	
	e.g, these'are a dataset of housing price in one place, we can get a nearly linear 
	relation between the house size and house price, when we want to know how much need to 
	pay for a 1200 feet^2 house, we can get the price from the linear line.
	
	And the housing problem is a regression problem, which will predict real-valued output.
